In reality, once plastic deformation occurs and the foundation is pushed further into the ground, the capacity of the foundation increases. Thus the size of the yield surface is not fixed, but increases as plastic deformation occurs. It is reasonable to link this increase only to further embedment, and not for instance to horizontal movement, since there is no reason to suppose that a horizontal movement increases the capacity. In simple force resultant models the size of the yield surface is therefore simply a function of the vertical plastic strain\n",
